Thanks to everyone who has sent in bug reports over the past few days! We've just released Journey version 2.6.1, which fixes some of the most glaring bugs: 

* Added functionality to delete a survey
* Fixed the error message when trying to change the title of a survey
* Amending a response or resuming a partial response no longer gives an error
* Big freeform fields now span the width of the page, and are displayed on their own line
* Fixed compatibility with older versions of Firefox and IE

Thanks everyone, and please keep sending in those bug reports! There are still quite a few outstanding ones we didn't get to in this release, so please stay tuned for 2.6.2, coming soon.
