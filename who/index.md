## Who is Sugar Pond?

Sugar Pond is the Nat Budin's little one-man software development side project.  Nat develops a few apps, mostly to support the live action roleplaying hobby.  Nat enjoys talking about himself in the third person.

### What has Sugar Pond ever done for us?

Well, here's a list.  Possibly incomplete and out-of-date.

* [Journey](https://www.journeysurveys.com) - a simple yet powerful online survey tool.  Once a commercial product, now donation-supported.
* [Vellum](http://vellum.aegames.org) - a collaborative writing tool designed for the needs of freeform larp writers.
* [Illyan](https://github.com/nbudin/illyan) - an account management app and CAS server.  Used for single sign on at [Sugar Pond Account Central](https://accounts.sugarpond.net).
* [ProCon](https://github.com/nbudin/procon) - a convention management and registration app created for Brandeis University's Festival of the LARPs.
* [Ponzi](http://ponzi.natbudin.com) - a very basic debt tracker for roommates.
