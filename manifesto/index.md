## What we're about

### Communication

Sugar Pond is built around communication.  We genuinely want to hear what you have to say, and we're eager to have conversations with our customers.  Because without communication, how can we possibly know if we're doing the right thing?

When you ask to talk to someone at Sugar Pond, you get a real person, with a name and a personal email address - a person who treats you like a fellow human being.  If we mean "I don't know," we're going to say "I don't know" and tell you how we're going to try to find out.  If we disagree with you, we're going to politely disagree and give you a rationale.  And if we've screwed up, we'll sincerely apologize, take corrective action as soon as we possibly can, and keep you in the loop about it.

### User Empowerment

When you're using a Sugar Pond product, you're in control.  If you create something, we think you should be able to use it however you want to.  Take it to a different web site, export it to a file, or delete it permanently.  It's up to you, because you own your data.

### Community

Look, we admit it: we're standing on the shoulders of giants.  Other people wrote [the application framework we use](http://www.rubyonrails.com), [the web server we run on](http://nginx.net), and [our content management system](http://jekyllrb.com).  Without these generous people, Sugar Pond really couldn't exist.

That's why we feel it's important to give back.  Our products are released under [open-source licenses](http://www.opensource.org).  You can download the source code for [Journey](http://github.com/nbudin/journey) if you want to - and we hope you will.  Whenever we make improvements to an existing piece of software, we contribute those back too - for example, we've contributed code to [Jester](http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/jester/) and [google4r-checkout](http://code.google.com/p/google-checkout-ruby-sample-code/).  It's our hope that we can make a positive contribution to the software development communities that helped us get to where we are today.
