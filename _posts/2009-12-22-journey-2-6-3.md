Happy holidays, everyone! Here's your present: a major update for Journey. There are way too many new things to list here, but some of the highlights are: 

* **Dashboard:** a new front page which lets you see your surveys, responses, and subscription info at a glance, including RSS feeds of what's new!
* **Preview:** take a look at a survey before filling it out.
* **Private surveys:** don't want your survey on the front page of Journey? Now you can opt out.
* **Publishing:** we've got 4 new ways to spread the word about your survey!
* **Copy a survey:** don't waste time recreating your old survey - just copy it and edit.

I'm really happy with the way this version turned out, and I hope you will be too. Please, leave your feedback and let me know what you think!
